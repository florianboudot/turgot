# Turgot 3D

## The project

_Turgot 3D_ is the project of a 3D interpretation of Turgot map of Paris.

## The original paper map of 1739

_The Turgot map was published in 1739 as an atlas of twenty non-overlapping sectional bird's-eye-view maps in isometric perspective toward the southeast. Each sectional map consists of double-facing sheets and is 80 cm (31 in) wide; the first row is 48 cm (19 in) high, while the remaining rows are 50 cm (20 in) high. The assembled map is 250.5 cm (98.5 in) in height and 322.5 cm (127 in) in width._

_Turgot's map has been described as "the first all-comprising graphical inventory of the capital, down to the last orchard and tree, detailing every house and naming even the most modest cul-de-sac"._
